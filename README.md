# .windsurfrules Sample

This repository contains custom instruction files (`.windsurfrules`) for Windsurf. 
It's an optimized adaptation of [cursorrules](https://github.com/kinopeeai/cursorrules) for Windsurf Cascade.

## Structure

The configuration contains specifications for tech stacks, API version management, and project structures. Two versions are available:
- v1: A streamlined version with predefined settings
- v5: A fully configurable version with extensive customization options

Note: Testing has been conducted in specific environments and timeframes. Results may vary across different use cases and environments. Consider these `.windsurfrules` as templates for your specific project requirements.

## Usage

1. Place the `.windsurfrules` file in your project's root directory
   - Alternatively, paste the contents via [Windsurf - Settings] > [Set Workspace AI Rules] > [Edit Rules]
   - For full configuration control: [v5-en/.windsurfrules](v5-en/.windsurfrules)
   - For standard implementation: [v1-en/.windsurfrules](v1-en/.windsurfrules)

2. Customize the technical specifications in v5:
   - Use Windsurf Cascade for editing
   - Without reference files, update rules using language/framework-specific best practices
   - Update specifications as your project evolves

3. Custom instructions are most effective when combined with task-specific prompts and contextual reference materials.

## Important Notes

- Effectiveness decreases if content conflicts with the Global AI Rules. Review the Global AI Rules thoroughly.
